Application for the organization and scheduling of irrigation in Ann Morrison Park in Boise, ID

Purpose

	An application that helps organize and plan irrigation schedules in Ann Morrison Park

	Has several tools and functions explained below

	The spreadsheet came about as an answer to some problems I encountered in my daily activities around the park.

	For example, when I started managing the park I noted how easy it was to forget to turn a pump on or to forget to turn a zone off etc.

	This primary need was what led to the formulation of my main ideas for the spreadsheet.

	Once I decided to create the spreadsheet I did an assessment of other needs that it could possibly help address

Need assessment
	High rate of mistakes
	Low accountability
	Lack of optimization
	
Goals for the application
	Easy to learn/use
	increase productivity
	Show the system in a manageable way
	provide tools to help maximize system efficiency
	provide recordkeeping functions

Main functions of the application.
	Bar chart - Help show and organize programs and runtimes
	Flow chart - Help optimize the system
	Plot output - Helps connect the spreadsheet to the real world
	Map - More intuitive view of the park systems - still in the works
	Log - Recordkeeping for greater accountability

Future
	I would like to add some functionality and increase the usefulness of the map
	
	This spreadsheet or parts of it could be made remotely accessible by me and my supervisors with some small amount of effort.
